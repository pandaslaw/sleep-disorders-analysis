# Sleep disorders analysis

This project is an attempt to understand, investigate and study sleep process and disorders related to it with the help of different datasets and data analysis tools.

It is hard to overestimate the importance of sleep in our lives. But still there are many people who consider sleep as a rudiment, as an annoying "bug" of a human being or even as a lack of willpower to stay awake and perform longer. Numerous researches (i.e. [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6281147/) and [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/8/2883/pdf)) totally disagree with such opinion and show the great importance of sleep. The lack of sleep hours may lead to disorders such as poor immune functioning, cardiovascular disease, diabetes. 

So it is highly important to track the quality of sleep in order to prevent or fix sleep disorders so that one could escape from serious consequences. 

<b>Possible sleep disorders:</b> insomnia, restless sleep (possible problem with REM and non-REM sleep), hard to fall asleep (possible problem with melatonin or other hormones), hard to wake up (lack of sleep hours or the consequence of previous disorders) and etc.

<b>Metrics to track:</b> physical activity during day, body temperature, heartbeat rate, the level of hormones, is there any genetic diseases. Try to compare metrics of people who fall asleep in 5 minutes and people with insomnia.
